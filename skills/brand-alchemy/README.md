## Core Capabilities

When invoked, the skill commands the AI agent to act as an elite branding consultant through a rigorous protocol:

* **The Interrogation**: Forces the AI to stop and ask critical discovery questions (Core, Audience, Alternative, Vibe) to extract your brand's true DNA before generating names.
* **Strategic Positioning**: Applies frameworks from April Dunford ("Obviously Awesome") and Category Design ("Play Bigger") to position your startup against the status quo.
* **Phonosemantics & Lexicon Science**: Uses sound symbolism (Plosives, Fricatives, Vowel Size) to engineer names that subconsciously communicate speed, power, or luxury.
* **Universal Domain Verification**: Automatically runs a robust Python script to check DNS and RDAP availability for any TLD (`.com`, `.io`, `.ai`, `.tech`, etc.), ensuring you don't fall in love with a taken name.

## How to Prompt the AI

Once the skill is installed, simply ask the AI to help you name your startup or build a brand strategy.

> "Help me name my AI distribution startup. We help technical founders get users."

The AI will automatically pause and initiate **Step 1: The Interrogation**, asking you specific questions about your core offering, audience, alternatives, and desired brand vibe.
